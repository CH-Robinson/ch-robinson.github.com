COVID-19 has ramped up to a deafening crescendo in our world, as we are being asked to stay home, skip group activities and share acts of kindness to support people in need.

At C.H. Robinson today, 64% (approximately 10,000) of our employees are working from home, full time. Prior to COVID-19, we only had a few hundred people working remotely on a regular basis. How did we accomplish such a digital transformation?

We started having meetings with business leaders and making plans back in January. Fast forward to March 6, when we learned one of our offices needed to have all their employees work from home for the next two weeks out of an abundance of caution after one of their teammates encountered someone diagnosed with COVID-19. We had been preparing continuity plans and prioritizing key upgrades to our systems in preparation for this, but they were 4-5 weeks from being ready. Now, with 30 minutes notice, we had to use them for one of our offices. This started the domino effect across C.H. Robinson to get all our locations ready now, not knowing when or where the next domino could fall.

We dusted off and engineered a softphone client so employees with laptops could log in to their phones and talk with customers. We pushed the client to our laptops in a matter of days, but with 2/3 of our employees using desktops, we needed to find a solution for working from any PC fast. Partnering with our VDI vendor, we made a strategic investment in a new license to cover all our desktop users coming in from outside the C.H. Robinson network, instantly enabling remote working for nearly 10,000 employees. Since we used the VDI technology already from inside our offices, we had the infrastructure we needed to support them once they were able to connect from home.

The Infrastructure Engineering Team then prepared our softphone for use in our VDI environment and deployed it a matter of days.

For our Call Center employees, we quickly worked with our vendors to get 90-day licenses to support 1,000 installations of the call center softphone. Our engineers got it packaged and installed on every laptop we could deploy and engineered dozens of virtual desktops so anyone without a laptop could use it from any PC with an internet connection.

At C.H. Robinson, we use Lync 2013 as our primary collaboration platform and were in the process of planning the upgrade to Skype for Business including new servers. We rapidly accelerated that upgrade and completed the migration from kick off to go live in 20 days, just as the Lync 2013 servers were starting to fail under the load of thousands of new remote workers.

As our remote headcount increased, we watched our VPN capacity fill up. Again, our Infrastructure Engineers jumped in and created capacity using infrastructure from our back up data center and deployed it to production emailing groups of users to use the new VPN connection to balance the load.

All the while, our Employee Experience experts worked with Engineering and HR to create documentation for using the technology and working remotely. They trained our power users and our Service Desk on how to configure and support working remotely with this technology. Our Service Desk reorganized their teams and refactored their processes to handle the immediate 300% increase in help call volume. Call wait times were managed and over the course of a week, we were back to wait times in the single digits quickly.

Over the course of two weeks, we engineered and deployed critical infrastructure. Today we are comfortably supporting over 10,000 C.H. Robinson employees working remotely and they're supporting our customers in their most critical time of need.

Business leaders from the CEO down are praising the efforts of IT to scale at a moment's notice and execute our plans with a high degree of precision and positive employee experience.

At C.H. Robinson, we place a tremendous value in our ability to execute under pressure and rise to the challenge when our customers need us the most. In IT, we feel the same way about taking care of our business so they can take care of our customers. It's the Robinson Way.
